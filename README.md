# @kenzoxx/multiply-tool

This is my first npm CLI app that multiplies two numbers and returns the result.

Usage
You can use the CLI tool by running:

bash
Copy code
multiply <number1> <number2>
For example:

bash
Copy code
multiply 3 5
This will output:

bash
Copy code
15
Alternatively, you can run the tool using npx without installing it globally:

bash
Copy code
npx @kenzoxx/multiply-tool 3 5
How it Works
The tool takes two numbers as arguments, multiplies them, and prints the result to the console.
